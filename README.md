this wasn't too bad, we had a few minor hiccups but I made it, this looks way better than the first two portfolio's I had, and it didn't take as long. I understand css much better now, I can solve problems on my own for the most part with css. SO now it's time to move on with javascript and really graspt the concent, I understand the outlining of it but I get confused trying to write it myself. once the javascript is completed for the front end i'll move on to the back end and get my server up and going.
CSS is so import, I still can't seem to get the navigation to work so I tried a differen't nav which I like the look of it. I need to get my event listener to work still super frustrating! I need to make the nav mobile friendly as well.
