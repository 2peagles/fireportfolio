this wasn't too bad, we had a few minor hiccups but I made it, this looks way better than the first two portfolio's I had, and it didn't take as long. I understand css much better now, I can solve problems on my own for the most part with css. SO now it's time to move on with javascript and really graspt the concent, I understand the outlining of it but I get confused trying to write it myself. once the javascript is completed for the front end i'll move on to the back end and get my server up and going.
