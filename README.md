this wasn't too bad, we had a few minor hiccups but I made it, this looks way better than the first two portfolio's I had, and it didn't take as long. I understand css much better now, I can solve problems on my own for the most part with css. SO now it's time to move on with javascript, I understand the outlining of it but I get confused trying to write it myself. once the javascript is completed for the front end i'll move on to the back end and get my server up and going.
CSS is so import, I still can't seem to get the navigation to work so I tried a differen't nav which I like the look of it. I need to get my event listener to work still super frustrating! I need to make the nav mobile friendly as well.
So I decided to make my sidebar to be the same color so it's more cohesive I changed the the sidebar and navbar color on scroll added a circle of my skills and fixed the mobile navbar's contents to be center. I did all the css myself and I only used react-router-hash-link for the scroll method and tsparticles. I have a better understanding of hooks now haven used them a few times now. 
I had a ton of fun building this and I hope it looks good to other people, either way I'm proud of myself.

I was about to create my project links through here https://postimages.org/
